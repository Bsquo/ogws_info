Resources/information that I've gathered during my work with OGWS.  
  
## Index
- `RSPE_r1.dmap`: Symbol map (NTSC-U, v1.01) for use with the Dolphin emulator, to aid in debugging. Converted from the decompilation Ghidra project. Updated when I get the chance.  
  
- `RSPE_r1.map`: Symbol map (NTSC-U, v1.01) for use with Ghidra when loading the Wii Sports DOL.  
  
- `RSPE_r1.csv`: Symbol map (NTSC-U, v1.01) in CSV form, for whatever data analysis you may want to do.
